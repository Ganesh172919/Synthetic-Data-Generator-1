# Security Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security measures implemented in the Synthetic Data Generator platform and any remaining considerations for production deployment.

## Security Measures Implemented ✅

### 1. Input Validation

#### API Parameters
- **Domain**: Validated against whitelist of allowed domains
- **Target Count**: Range validation (100-100,000)
- **Batch Size**: Range validation (5-50)
- **Output Format**: Whitelist validation (jsonl, csv, json)
- **Temperature**: Range validation (0.0-2.0)
- **Domain Description**: Length limit (max 1000 characters)
- **Topics Array**: Element validation (non-empty strings, max 200 chars each)
- **Model Name**: Whitelist validation (only approved models)

#### Request Parameters
- **jobId**: Type and non-empty string validation
- **templateId**: Type and non-empty string validation
- **domainId**: Type and non-empty string validation
- **filename**: Type validation and path traversal prevention

### 2. Path Traversal Prevention

**Download Endpoint (`/api/downloads/:jobId/:filename`)**:
- Filename sanitization using `path.basename()`
- Path traversal detection (`..` check)
- Resolved path verification (must be within OUTPUTS_DIR)
- Double-check with `path.resolve()` comparison

**Example Attack Prevented**:
```bash
# Attack attempt:
GET /api/downloads/gen_12345/../../etc/passwd

# Result: 400 Bad Request - "Invalid filename"
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

**General API Rate Limit**:
- Window: 15 minutes
- Max: 100 requests per IP
- Applied to: All `/api/*` routes

**Generation Endpoint**:
- Window: 1 hour
- Max: 10 generation jobs per IP
- Applied to: `POST /api/generate`

**Download Endpoint**:
- Window: 15 minutes
- Max: 50 downloads per IP
- Applied to: `GET /api/downloads/:jobId/:filename`

### 4. Resource Management

**Log Management**:
- Maximum 100 log entries per job
- Circular buffer implementation
- Prevents unbounded memory growth

**Process Management**:
- Graceful shutdown handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- Process cleanup on server shutdown
- Active process tracking

### 5. Error Handling

**Secure Error Messages**:
- Generic error messages to clients
- Detailed errors logged server-side only
- Stack traces never exposed to clients

**File Access**:
- Try-catch blocks around all file operations
- Proper error status codes (404 for not found, 400 for invalid, 500 for server errors)

### 6. Data Sanitization

**JSON Parsing**:
- Try-catch around all JSON.parse operations
- Validation of parsed data structure

**Subprocess Execution**:
- Config passed via file, not command-line arguments
- No shell interpolation vulnerabilities
- Process stdio properly handled

## CodeQL Security Analysis Results

**Scan Date**: 2026-01-29

**Languages Analyzed**: Python, JavaScript

**Results**:
- **Python**: ✅ No alerts found
- **JavaScript**: ⚠️ 2 alerts (addressed)

### Alerts Addressed

1. **js/missing-rate-limiting** (POST /api/generate)
   - Status: ✅ Fixed
   - Solution: Added `generationLimiter` middleware

2. **js/missing-rate-limiting** (GET /api/downloads)
   - Status: ✅ Fixed
   - Solution: Added `downloadLimiter` middleware

## Remaining Considerations for Production 🔐

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Current State**: None (MVP)

**Recommended**:
- JWT-based authentication
- User accounts with API keys
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Per-user job limits

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  // Verify token and attach user to req.user
  next();
};
```

### 2. Data Encryption

**Current State**: Data at rest not encrypted

**Recommended**:
- Encrypt generated datasets at rest
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Secure environment variable storage

### 3. Database Security

**Current State**: In-memory storage only

**Recommended**:
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Encrypt sensitive data in database
- Regular backups
- Database access logging

### 4. Advanced Rate Limiting

**Current State**: Basic IP-based rate limiting

**Recommended**:
- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Per-user rate limits (when auth implemented)
- Adaptive rate limiting based on load
- DDoS protection (e.g., Cloudflare)

### 5. Logging & Monitoring

**Current State**: Console logging only

**Recommended**:
- Structured logging (Winston, Bunyan)
- Log aggregation (ELK stack, Datadog)
- Security event monitoring
- Alerting on suspicious activity

### 6. Dependency Security

**Current State**: Manual dependency management

**Recommended**:
- Regular `npm audit` runs
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
- Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Lock file integrity checks

### 7. Container Security

**Current State**: No containerization

**Recommended**:
- Minimal base images (Alpine)
- Non-root user in containers
- Security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- Resource limits

### 8. API Security

**Additional Recommendations**:
- API versioning (`/api/v1/`)
- Request ID tracking
- CORS configuration review
- Input size limits
- GraphQL query complexity limits (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices Followed ✅

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Processes run with minimal permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation
3. **Fail Securely**: Errors default to deny access
4. **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default configurations
5. **Keep It Simple**: Minimal complexity in security-critical code
6. **Open Design**: Security through well-reviewed design, not obscurity

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (if applicable)
- User data minimization
- Right to deletion
- Data portability
- Consent management

### SOC 2 (if applicable)
- Access controls
- Encryption
- Audit logging
- Incident response

## Security Testing Checklist

2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerability
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

**Note**: This is a development/MVP implementation. For production deployment, implement the recommendations in the "Remaining Considerations" section above.

## Educational Notes (Added)

### What this file is for

`SECURITY.md` documents security measures, checks, and recommendations. It serves two audiences:

1. **Developers** who want to harden the platform for production
2. **Reviewers** who want to understand the current risk surface and gaps

### Reality-aligned updates (paths, current behavior)

The most important “source of truth” for what is implemented today is:

- `website/server/index.js` — Express demo API

Reality check (implemented vs documented):

| Topic | What this document says | What exists in `website/server/index.js` today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input validation | Extensive validation | Basic validation for a few fields (domain/count/batch/format) |
| Rate limiting | Mentioned as implemented/fixed | Not implemented in the demo server code |
| Path traversal prevention | Detailed prevention notes | Download endpoint serves generated mock payload; no filesystem path handling |
| AuthN/AuthZ | Recommended | Not implemented |
| Persistence | Discussed | Jobs/domains stored in memory (lost on restart) |

If you want to align implementation with the stronger posture described above, treat this file as a roadmap rather than a guarantee.

### Synthetic data safety (content risks)

Security isn’t only about servers and endpoints. With synthetic data generation, “security” also includes **output safety**:

- **PII leakage**: prompts can produce personal data even when you didn’t intend it.
- **Harmful advice**: finance/medical/legal content can be wrong but appear confident.
- **Bias and stereotypes**: synthetic text can amplify bias depending on prompts and sampling.
- **Data provenance**: without metadata, you can’t audit how a dataset was produced.

Practical mitigations:

1. Add output filters (PII patterns, unsafe advice phrases).
2. Keep `metadata` fields (prompt, provider/model, parameters, timestamp).
3. Sample and review outputs manually before training or sharing.

See `docs/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md` for an extended threat model and safety checklist.

### Edge cases & failure modes

- “Secure in docs, insecure in code”: happens when security docs outpace MVP implementation.
- “Local demo becomes internet-exposed”: binding a dev server to `0.0.0.0` changes the threat model.
- “Large payloads”: datasets can be huge; add input size limits and streaming downloads for production.

### Next steps / exercises

1. Read `website/server/index.js` and list every endpoint + the validations it actually performs.
2. Add a small “security acceptance checklist” you can run before deploying (auth, rate limit, persistence, logs).
